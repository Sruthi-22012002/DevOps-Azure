### 1. Interpretation
> When any key on a keyboard is pressed, it needs to be converted into a binary number so that it can be processed by the computer and the typed character can appear on the screen.

### 2. OSI Model
* OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection
* The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework with seven layers that standardizes how different computer systems communicate.
* Each layer has a specific role in managing aspects like hardware, addressing, routing, and application-level interactions.
* It simplifies understanding and troubleshooting network processes.

### 3. Protocols
* A protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is transmitted and received between devices in a network.
* It ensures standardized communication, allowing different systems to understand and interact with each other.
  * TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
     >  TCP operates at the transport layer of the OSI model. It establishes a connection between two devices before data exchange, ensuring reliable and ordered delivery of information.

  * IP - Internet Protocol
  * UDP - User Datagram Protocol
    >  Also operating at the transport layer, UDP is a connectionless protocol that offers minimal services. It's like a 'fire and forget' approach for data transmission

### 4. Subnet
> Subnetting is a technique used in computer networking to divide a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks or subnets

 ### IP Address between the range 0 to 255 = 256
</div>

> Example :

ip1 = 192.168.1.33
ip2 = 192.168.1.62
Subnet calculation of these 2 ip's
