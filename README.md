Tomcat Setup, Deployment, and Maintenance
Overview
This document outlines the tasks and responsibilities assigned to team members for setting up and managing an Apache Tomcat server. The tasks include Tomcat installation, application deployment, log management, and monitoring of server health.

1. Tomcat Installation
Assigned to: Ranjitha Logesh

Task: Install Apache Tomcat on the designated server.
Steps to Follow:
Download the latest stable version of Apache Tomcat.
Unzip the downloaded package and place it in the desired directory.
Configure the environment variables (e.g., CATALINA_HOME and JAVA_HOME).
Verify the installation by starting Tomcat and accessing the default page (usually http://localhost:8080).
Expected Outcome: Apache Tomcat should be successfully installed and accessible on the default port.

2. Application Deployment
Assigned to: Sruthi VG

Task: Deploy the application on the Tomcat setup completed by Ranjitha.
Steps to Follow:
Obtain the application package in the .war format.
Access the Tomcat server and navigate to the webapps directory.
Place the .war file in the webapps directory; Tomcat should automatically deploy it.
Confirm deployment by accessing the application through the designated URL.
Expected Outcome: The application should be deployed successfully and accessible via the configured URL.

3. Log Management and Monitoring
Assigned to: Swathi S

Task: Set up log rotation, archiving, and monitoring of the Tomcat server.
Steps to Follow:
Log Rotation & Archiving:
Configure log rotation for Tomcat logs to archive every hour.
Use a tool like logrotate or Tomcat's built-in logging settings to manage this.
Ensure archived logs are stored in a designated directory with timestamps.
Monitoring & Email Notifications:
Write a script to monitor the status of the Tomcat service.
Set up a cron job to run the script every few minutes.
If Tomcat is in a stopped state or fails to start, the script should send an email notification to the team.
Set up email notifications using an SMTP server or a tool like sendmail.
Expected Outcome: Logs should rotate and archive every hour, and email notifications should be sent if the Tomcat server fails or stops.
