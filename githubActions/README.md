flowchart LR
    A[Developer] --> B[code]
    B --> C[Github repository]
    C <-- D[Tester]
    D --> E[Test Environment]
    C --> F[Test Success]
    F --> G[Production user]
```

### Sample :
```bash
# The name of the workflow that appears in the GitHub Actions tab.
name: githubAction Workflow 

# Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events
on:
  push:
   # Defines which branches will trigger the workflow. Only main will trigger it.
    branches:
      - main
# Defines a set of tasks (or jobs) the workflow will run.
jobs:
  # The name of this job.
  build and push:
    # Specifies the environment where the job will run.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Check out the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        # Refers to a prebuilt action from GitHubâ€™s marketplace, actions/checkout@v3, which checks out the repository so the workflow can access the code.
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: make the script exectable
        uses: sudo chmod +x date.sh

      - name: run the script
        uses: sh date.sh
```
